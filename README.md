# livetracking_dart
A live tracking app.

Description
============
1. This app uses flutter and OpenStreetMap.
2. Fetches data from phpMyAdmin/MySQL from the web

How it works
============
1. Grabs all the available data from the database and store it in the app.
2. Filters the data based on the `selectedDate` made by the user.
3. User can change the `timeFrom` and `timeTo` and the path of every single person available will be shown to the user.


What's Next
============
1. Still hasn't been implemented on real data.
2. Still struggle for constant switch of states of location services. (teleportation)
